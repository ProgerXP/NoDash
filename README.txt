NoDash.js - a terse utility library based on ES5 features
=========================================================

NoDash is yet another variant of Underscore.js and LoDash.js but with focus on:

  * native ES5 features - hence "No" for reinventing the wheel
  * minimum code - compact isolated functions (7 lines on average)
  * completeness - with ajax(), trim() and others needed in day-to-day development

With NoDash, you might not need another utility library and yet your bundle's
size will not suffer as it's smaller than Underscore and LoDash.

Size: 16K minified, 5K gzipped.
